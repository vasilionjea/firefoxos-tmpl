# A Starter Template for Open Web Apps

The is a minimal template that has a little HTML, CSS, and js to help
you start writing an [Open Web App](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/partners/).

This is a modified version of the [mortar](https://github.com/mozilla/mortar/)
template collection for building Open Web Apps.

# Usage

There are a few ways to get this template:

   1. `git clone git://github.com/vasilionjea/firefox-os-starter.git your-app-name`
   2. `volo create your-app-name vasilionjea/firefox-os-starter`

If you have node installed, you can run a development server with volo:

    cd your-app-name
    volo serve

View the app at `http://localhost:8008/` with the Firefox OS Simulator (it's an addon for firefox itself).
